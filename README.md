# Flashcard Web App  
Submitted by: **Sai Rithwik Kukunuri**

For this **Flashcard Web App** project, I have created an interactive system where users can study, learn, or play a guessing game using flashcards. The app displays flashcards in a random order and allows users to flip cards to view either the question or the answer. Users can click through the cards, making learning fun and engaging.

Time spent: **[2]** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following functionality **goals** have been completed:

- [x] User Input.
- [x] The user can enter their guess in a box before seeing the flipside of the card.
- [x] Clicking on a submit button shows visual feedback about whether the answer was correct or incorrect.
- [x] A back button displayed on the card can be used to return to the previous card in a set sequence
- [x] A next button displayed on the card can be used to navigate to the next card in a set sequence

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of the implemented features:

## Notes

The Flashcard Web App allows users to study using flashcards that display a question or an answer. Key challenges in this project included managing the card flipping logic, randomizing the order of the cards, and ensuring smooth transitions between the cards. The app now offers an interactive study tool for users to explore.
